Hey, I was recently in contact with Jay about adding more Facebook Accounts for testing.
Visit the site findmyfbid.com while logged into any Facebook Account, follow the simple instructions,
an then message anyone that is currently already an admin on the app, myself, Christian, John Smith can 
approve that number as a loginable account on the app.
